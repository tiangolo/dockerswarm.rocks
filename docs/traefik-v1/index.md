# Traefik v1

Here are the previous guides for Traefik using version 1.

You can consider them obsolete, and you should probably use instead the most **recent version** at <a href="https://dockerswarm.rocks/traefik/" class="external-link" target="_blank">DockerSwarm.rocks/traefik/</a>.

But they are kept here for reference, in case you were using them and already have some stacks deployed with them.
